This is a personal project, recently created, whose objective is as a learning experience.

It is expected to be a 3D roguelite mobile videogame, in which we will create our own customizable character, building up its abilities and equipment
fighting through the different levels.

Its main reference in terms of game loop is Let It Die, a free PS4 videogame.
